# 522_lab_01

This repository contains a shell script that generates a simple directory
structure common to many data science projects.

It accepts one argument: a three letter character string that is
either `"MIT"` or `"GNU"`. If either is supplied, the `LICENCE.md` file that
is created by the shell script will contain the MIT or GNU GPL licence. If
neither is supplied, then the `LICENCE.md` file is empty.

Note: this is a lab assignment for DSCI 522 in UBC's MDS program.
